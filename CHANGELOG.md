## [1.4.0-beta.12] - 2026-07-07 (Pre-Release)
### Changes
- **custom sections take complete section code** (overview + per-room): the YAML field now accepts a full section config (`type: grid` + `cards:` — exactly what HA's raw editor shows), and section-level options pass straight through, notably runtime `visibility` (hides the section including its heading when the condition is not met) and `column_span`. The heading is a regular `heading` card inside the YAML; the separate heading/icon editor fields are gone. Pasting a single card or a list of cards still works (auto-wrapped into a grid section), and configs created before beta.12 keep rendering unchanged via the legacy path ([#351](https://github.com/TheRealSimon42/simon42-dashboard-strategy/pull/351))

## [1.4.0-beta.11] - 2026-07-07 (Pre-Release)
### Features
- **experimental** maintenance summary tile + view (`show_maintenance_summary`, `/maintenance`): critical batteries and unavailable devices (one tile per device — flagged only when ALL of its visible entities are unavailable) in the main content; on HA ≥ 2026.3 a sidebar with HA's built-in repairs/updates/discovered-devices cards (admin-only, self-hiding), a HACS quick link, a 24h activity log scoped to exactly the reported entities (`show_maintenance_activity`) and curated simon42 video tips matched to the installed integrations (`show_video_tips` — static list in the bundle, no fetch/tracking, dismissable per browser); updates render as tiles on older HA versions ([#344](https://github.com/TheRealSimon42/simon42-dashboard-strategy/pull/344))
- maintenance tile/view visibility restrictable to selected users (`maintenance_visible_users`, native Lovelace user condition; person-based picker in the editor — display logic, not access control)

### Bug Fixes
- updates collection is now category-inclusive: update entities carrying an `entity_category` (e.g. Shelly firmware = config) were silently dropped from the pending-updates overview section — now counted consistently in the overview section, the maintenance view and the tile counter ([#344](https://github.com/TheRealSimon42/simon42-dashboard-strategy/pull/344))

## [1.4.0-beta.10] - 2026-07-06 (Pre-Release)
### Changes
- rooms: the camera wrapper card with play/stop live toggle (introduced in beta.9) is now **opt-in** via `camera_live_toggle` (sub-toggle in the editor). By default room cameras render exactly as before beta.9: auto-refreshing picture-glance/picture-entity cards, Aqara cameras live ([#342](https://github.com/TheRealSimon42/simon42-dashboard-strategy/pull/342))

## [1.4.0-beta.9] - 2026-07-06 (Pre-Release)
### Features
- rooms: per-area block ordering (`areas_options.{id}.stacks_order`) — drag & drop panel per area in the editor reorders the generated room sections (cameras, lights, climate, …); closes [#293](https://github.com/TheRealSimon42/simon42-dashboard-strategy/issues/293) (ported from [#327](https://github.com/TheRealSimon42/simon42-dashboard-strategy/pull/327)/[#328](https://github.com/TheRealSimon42/simon42-dashboard-strategy/pull/328) by @Cyberhunter88)
- rooms: opt-in UPS block (`show_ups_in_rooms`) — one section per detected UPS (NUT/apcupsd platforms or "UPS"/"USV" in the device name) with battery gauge and role-sorted sensors (ported from [#327](https://github.com/TheRealSimon42/simon42-dashboard-strategy/pull/327) by @Cyberhunter88)
- rooms: opt-in energy block (`show_energy_in_rooms`) — the area's power/energy/water/gas sensors as their own section (ported from [#327](https://github.com/TheRealSimon42/simon42-dashboard-strategy/pull/327) by @Cyberhunter88)
- rooms: camera wrapper card with manual live toggle — room cameras start as stills and stream only after the play button; cameras without snapshot support (Aqara) start live automatically (ported from [#326](https://github.com/TheRealSimon42/simon42-dashboard-strategy/pull/326) by @Cyberhunter88)
- navigation: pinned room tabs (`areas_display.nav_items`) — selected room views stay in the navigation even when room views render as subviews; pin button per area row in the editor (ported from [#333](https://github.com/TheRealSimon42/simon42-dashboard-strategy/pull/333) by @Cyberhunter88)
- opt-in `hide_unavailable_entities` — generated cards/badges hide dynamically while their entity is `unavailable`/`unknown`, fully affected sections auto-hide, summary counts follow; custom cards/sections/views stay untouched (ported from [#325](https://github.com/TheRealSimon42/simon42-dashboard-strategy/pull/325) by @Cyberhunter88)
- opt-in `dense_section_placement` — fill grid gaps in all generated sections views (ported from [#334](https://github.com/TheRealSimon42/simon42-dashboard-strategy/pull/334) by @simatec)

## [1.4.0-beta.8] - 2026-07-05 (Pre-Release)
### Features
- security view: opt-in cameras (`show_cameras_in_security`) as lean still-image cards à la HA's security panel — one card per camera device with the preferred Reolink stream; the cameras heading deep-links to the camera view when enabled ([#336](https://github.com/TheRealSimon42/simon42-dashboard-strategy/pull/336))
- security view: HA-style layout (`group_security_by_areas`, recommended) — all areas stacked and grouped by floors, area headings link to the room views, activity log pinned as a right-hand sidebar
- security view: 24h activity log (`show_security_activity`, default on) over security entities + persons — leading section in category mode (optional at the end via `security_activity_position`), sidebar in the HA-style layout; new `no_seclog` label excludes entities from the log while keeping them in the view
- security view: camera exclusion list (`hidden_cameras`) — hides cameras from the security AND camera views, room views unaffected; only cameras from dashboard-included areas are offered
- security view: filter parity with HA's security panel — `safety`/`tamper` sensors get their own category (surfaces e.g. Versatile Thermostat per-room safety states), `carbon_monoxide` joins smoke/gas
- **experimental** camera view (`show_camera_view`, `/cameras`): per camera device a live picture, spotlight tile (with brightness slider when supported), Reolink PTZ pad (detected via translation_key) and a recordings deep-link into the media browser; optional LLM Vision event timelines (`show_camera_events`, default off — the card re-fetches on every state change, see [llmvision-card#112](https://github.com/valentinfrlch/llmvision-card/issues/112)); cameras headings in room views link to the camera view when enabled
- weather: opt-in DWD Pollenflug card (`show_pollen_card`) below the weather card — live pollen load (today + tomorrow) from the HACS `dwd_pollenflug` integration, sensors auto-discovered, toggle only offered while the integration is installed

## [1.4.0-beta.7] - 2026-07-05 (Pre-Release)
### Features
- HA 2026.x alignment: registry staleness fix (views no longer serve stale entity/area data until hard-reload), strategy appears in HA's "new dashboard" dialog, `registryDependencies` declared, summary card removed from the card picker ([#329](https://github.com/TheRealSimon42/simon42-dashboard-strategy/pull/329))
- rooms: opt-in vacuum & mower section (`show_vacuums_section_in_rooms`), `lawn_mower` entities now categorized in room views, cameras toggleable per room ([#330](https://github.com/TheRealSimon42/simon42-dashboard-strategy/pull/330))

## [1.4.0-beta.6] - 2026-07-05 (Pre-Release)
### Features
- `lights_sort_by: name` sorts lights alphabetically instead of by last change — lights view, room views and nested groups (ported from [#250](https://github.com/TheRealSimon42/simon42-dashboard-strategy/pull/250) by @TheDave94, refs [#168](https://github.com/TheRealSimon42/simon42-dashboard-strategy/issues/168))

## [1.4.0-beta.5] - 2026-07-05 (Pre-Release)
### Features
- `show_battery_view`: keep the /batteries subview available even when the battery summary is hidden — for badges/links that deep-link to the page (closes [#315](https://github.com/TheRealSimon42/simon42-dashboard-strategy/issues/315))

## [1.4.0-beta.4] - 2026-07-05 (Pre-Release)
### Features
- per-room custom sections: `areas_options.{areaId}.custom_sections[]` renders user-declared section blocks above or below the generated room sections (`position: top|bottom`), editable per area in the editor (closes [#222](https://github.com/TheRealSimon42/simon42-dashboard-strategy/issues/222), [#210](https://github.com/TheRealSimon42/simon42-dashboard-strategy/issues/210); per-area idea from [#298](https://github.com/TheRealSimon42/simon42-dashboard-strategy/pull/298) by @Cyberhunter88)

## [1.4.0-beta.3] - 2026-07-05 (Pre-Release)
### Features
- `custom_sections`: user-declared overview sections without forking — key works in sections_order (drag & drop panel), as custom_cards target_section and in section_visibility rules; built-in collision guard, duplicate keys first-wins, auto-hide when empty; full editor panel with inline key/YAML validation (closes [#153](https://github.com/TheRealSimon42/simon42-dashboard-strategy/issues/153); design from [#283](https://github.com/TheRealSimon42/simon42-dashboard-strategy/pull/283) by @TheDave94)

## [1.4.0-beta.2] - 2026-07-04 (Pre-Release)
### Refactoring
- section registry as single source of truth for overview sections — adding a section no longer requires manual editor wiring; missing wiring is now a compile error. No user-visible changes ([#312](https://github.com/TheRealSimon42/simon42-dashboard-strategy/pull/312))

### Documentation
- README overhaul: all v1.3.5/v1.4.0 features documented, full config reference with "since version" column, updated architecture numbers; refreshed HACS info.md; backfilled changelog

### Chores
- ci: ignore the new HACS license check — CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 is a deliberate license choice but not SPDX-detectable by GitHub's licensee (would block every PR)
