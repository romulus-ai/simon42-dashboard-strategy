# Simon42 Dashboard Strategy

Custom Lovelace Dashboard Strategy for Home Assistant. Generates dynamic dashboards from area/device/entity metadata with flexible user configuration. This project is actively used by Simons loved YouTube viewers — clean, stable code is top priority.

## Architecture

**Language:** TypeScript (ES2020, strict mode)
**Build:** Webpack → code-split chunks (main + lit + core + views + editor on-demand)
**Distribution:** HACS-compatible (Custom Repository), deployed to `/config/www/community/simon42-dashboard-strategy/`

### Data Flow

1. **Entry Point** registers custom elements, calls `Registry.initialize(hass, config)` synchronously
2. **Registry** reads entity/device/area data from `hass` object (synchronous), builds pre-computed Maps/Sets
3. **Utils** collect persons, weather, favorites using pre-filtered Registry methods
4. **Section Builders** generate overview, areas, weather/energy sections
5. **View Builders** generate utility views (lights, covers, security, batteries, climate) + per-area room views
6. **Custom Cards** render reactive UI (real-time `hass` updates via `set hass()`)

### Registry — Core Design

The Registry is a **static singleton** (no instance, all static members). Initialized once, then provides O(1) lookups everywhere.

**Synchronous Init** (reads directly from hass object, no WebSocket needed):
```
Object.values(hass.entities)  → EntityRegistryDisplayEntry[]
Object.values(hass.devices)   → DeviceRegistryEntry[]
Object.values(hass.areas)     → AreaRegistryEntry[]
```
Called once in dashboard strategy `generate()` before views are returned. Idempotent — subsequent calls in view strategies are no-ops.

**Pre-Computed Maps:**

| Map | Key | Value | Filtered? |
|-----|-----|-------|-----------|
| `_entityById` | entity_id | EntityRegistryDisplayEntry | Raw |
| `_deviceById` | device_id | DeviceRegistryEntry | Raw |
| `_entitiesByDevice` | device_id | entity_id[] | Raw |
| `_entitiesByDomain` | domain | entity_id[] | Raw |
| `_entitiesByArea` | area_id | EntityRegistryDisplayEntry[] | Raw |
| `_visibleEntitiesByArea` | area_id | EntityRegistryDisplayEntry[] | **Pre-filtered** |
| `_visibleEntitiesByDomain` | domain | entity_id[] | **Pre-filtered** |
| `_configDiagEntitiesByArea` | area_id | EntityRegistryDisplayEntry[] | Config/diagnostic only |

Raw Maps stay available for the Editor (needs all entities for show/hide toggles).

**Pre-Filtering** (applied once during init via `_isEntityVisible()`):
- Not in `_excludeSet` (no "no_dboard" label)
- Not in `_hiddenFromConfig` (not in `areas_options.*.groups_options.*.hidden`)
- Not `hidden_by` (user or integration)
- Not `disabled_by` (user or integration)
- Not `entity_category` "config" or "diagnostic"

Downstream code uses pre-filtered methods directly — no redundant inline checks.

**Area resolution** (entity → area): `entity.area_id` → device area → parent device area. Since HA 2026.9 a device can be a *child* of another device (`parent_device_id`, e.g. one sub-device per camera lens); a child with `area_id: null` inherits the parent's area, exactly like HA's own `getDeviceAreaId`. Always resolve via `Registry.getDeviceAreaId(deviceId)` (or `getEffectiveDeviceAreaId()` from `utils/device-utils.ts` in the editor, which reads `hass.devices`) — never read `device.area_id` directly, or entities on child devices silently drop out of their room.

### Entity Filtering Pipeline

```
Entity → no_dboard label? → areas_options hidden? → Registry status (hidden_by, disabled_by)?
      → Category check (config/diagnostic excluded) → Platform filter → Dedup → Display
```

### HA Entity Registry vs. State-Attributes (CRITICAL)

Many entity properties exist ONLY in the Entity Registry, NOT in state attributes. Always use the registry as primary source:

| Property | Registry (`hass.entities[id]`) | State attributes |
|----------|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| `hidden_by` | "user", "integration", null | NOT available |
| `disabled_by` | "user", "integration", null | NOT available |
| `entity_category` | "config", "diagnostic", null | Sometimes copied, often missing |
| `platform` | "mobile_app", "mqtt", etc. | NOT available |
| `device_id` | device UUID | NOT available |

**Rule:** Always read `hidden_by`, `disabled_by`, `entity_category`, and `platform` from the registry. Group cards (lights, covers) get entities pre-filtered from the registry array — they have these fields directly on the entity object. The summary card works with `hass.states` keys and must look up registry entries via `hass.entities?.[id]`.

### Config Hierarchy

- **Global toggles**: show_weather, show_energy, show_summary_views, show_room_views, group_by_floors, show_covers_summary, show_clock_card, show_light_summary, show_security_summary, show_battery_summary, show_climate_summary, show_search_card, show_locks_in_rooms, hide_mobile_app_batteries, group_lights_by_floors, use_default_area_sort, show_switches_on_areas, show_alerts_on_areas
- **Layout**: summaries_columns (2 | 4)
- **Area-level**: areas_display.hidden, areas_display.order
- **Entity-level**: areas_options.{areaId}.groups_options.{domain}.hidden
- **Special**: room_pin_entities, alarm_entity, presence_simulation_entity, favorite_entities, custom_views

### Adding a New Overview Section

Overview sections are driven by `src/sections/section-registry.ts` (single source of truth). To add one:

1. Create the builder in `src/sections/<Name>Section.ts` (return `LovelaceSectionConfig | null`, `null` = auto-hide)
2. Add ONE entry to `SECTION_REGISTRY` (key, icon, labelKey, optional visibility toggle) — its position defines the default order
3. Wire the builder into `SECTION_BUILDERS` in `views/OverviewViewStrategy.ts`
4. Add i18n keys (`sections.<key>` + editor texts) in `translations/{de,en,ru}.json`

The `SectionKey` type, default order, editor drag & drop panel, visibility toggle, per-section visibility rules and `target_section` dropdown all derive from the registry entry — no editor changes needed. **Important:** `section-registry.ts` must stay pure data (no builder imports), otherwise the lazy editor chunk would pull in all section builders (see Chunk Architecture below).

## Complexity Hotspots

These files require extra care — changes here most likely cause regressions:

1. **editor/StrategyEditor.ts** — Editor state management, expand state persistence, config-changed events
2. **views/RoomViewStrategy.ts** — Entity categorization across 15+ device classes
3. **Registry.ts** — Central data layer, all views depend on its Maps/Sets
4. **utils/name-utils.ts** — Utilities used everywhere (changes ripple through entire codebase)

## Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `main` (e.g. `feature/climate-summary-view`)
2. Build: `npm run build` (production) or `npm run build-dev` (with source maps)
3. Deploy: copy `dist/` contents to `/Volumes/config/www/community/simon42-dashboard-strategy/`
4. Delete stale `.gz` and `.br` files after copying (HA serves compressed over `.js` if present)
5. Hard-refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R). HA restart only needed for structural changes, not logic changes
6. **Test on the live system** — always before pushing to GitHub!
7. Test via Playwright and/or HA MCP tools

**Build scripts:**
```
npm run build       # Production (minified, no source maps)
npm run build-dev   # Development (source maps)
npm run watch       # Dev + auto-rebuild on file changes
```

## Codacy Pitfalls (CI blocks on "high" findings)

- **No `const fn = () => ...` arrow function assignments** — Biome's Qwik rule false-positives on them ("Non-serializable expression must be wrapped with $(...)"). Use `function` declarations instead. Applies to src AND test files, and to **function-local** const arrows too, not just module level (hit repeatedly, latest in #336).
- No `any` in new signatures (`Record<string, unknown>` over `Record<string, any>`)
- No dynamic `obj[variable]` lookups on config objects — use `Map`/`Reflect.get` (detect-object-injection). **`hass.states[someVar]` in new/changed lines counts too** — use the `stateFor()`/`Reflect.get` helpers.
- **Always bind the catch parameter in async functions**: `catch (error: unknown)` — Codacy's security-node rule doesn't know optional catch binding (`catch {`).
- Codacy's API can report ghost findings pinned to lines that no longer block the quality gate — when a finding looks inexplicable, check the PR check status first instead of contorting the code.
- **The quality gate is `issueThreshold: 0`** — EVERY new finding blocks, Warning severity included, and **moved lines count as new lines** (refactor PRs get fully rescanned). Budget for this before large moves.
- **Reproduce the type-aware rules locally instead of API whack-a-mole:** temporary eslint flat config with `parserOptions.project` enabling `@typescript-eslint/no-unnecessary-condition` + `no-non-null-assertion`, run on the touched files. One pass finds everything (the PR-issues API paginates at 100 and hides findings).
- **Record-type lookups lie** (`tsconfig` has no `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`): `no-unnecessary-condition` demands removing `?.` on `Record` values that CAN be absent at runtime (e.g. `groups_options.badges`). Do NOT drop the guard — rewrite as `Reflect.get(obj, key) as T | undefined` so the condition stays type-honest. Only drop `?.`/fallbacks where the API really guarantees presence (`hass.states[x].attributes`, `hass.areas/devices/entities`, `EntityRegistryEntry.labels` — HA floor 2024.7).
- Array index access `arr[i]` also triggers detect-object-injection — use `arr.at(i)` (lib ES2022) + `splice(i, 1, next)` for writes.
- `xss/no-mixed-html` and `@typescript-eslint/no-confusing-void-expression` are file-level disabled in `src/editor/**` (mass false positives on lit-html / house-style event arrows); a no-op stub plugin in `eslint.config.mjs` keeps the directives valid locally. The `.codacy.yml` engine switch (adopted from oriel-dashboard) is currently NOT honored by our Codacy setup — disabling the legacy ESLint8 engine in the Codacy UI would supersede the inline disables.
- Semgrep flags `yaml.load()` as RCE — false positive for js-yaml v4 (safe schema by default); suppress with `// nosemgrep` on the call line.

## Git & Release Workflow

**Never commit directly to `main`.** Always use feature branches.

### Feature Development
1. `git checkout -b feature/<name>` from `main`
2. Develop, build, test on live system
3. **Source only — `dist/` is gitignored and never committed.** HACS serves the built files as release assets (see Release Automation below); old tags (≤ v1.3.4-beta.9) still carry their committed `dist/`
4. `git push -u origin feature/<name>`
5. Create PR from feature branch → `main` (triggers validation workflows: translation lint, build + bundle check. NOTE: hacs/action cannot be used here — it validates the branch TREE only and the tree deliberately has no `dist/`; real HACS installs from release assets instead)
6. **PR titles must be Conventional Commits** (`feat: …`, `fix: …`, `feat(scope)!: …`, `chore: …`) — squash merges make the PR title the commit message, and release-please derives version bumps and CHANGELOG entries from it. `feat`/`fix` trigger a release; `chore`/`docs`/`ci`/`refactor` don't. Runtime-relevant dependency bumps should therefore be merged as `fix(deps): …`, not `chore(deps): …`, or they never reach a release
7. Wait for CI to pass, then merge
8. Delete feature branch (local + remote)

### Release Automation (release-please, since #353; dist/ removal history: #190)

Releases are cut by **release-please** — no manual version bumps, no manual CHANGELOG edits, no manual tags:

1. On every push to `main`, `release-please.yml` maintains a permanent **Release PR** (runs under the `simon42-release-bot` GitHub App — GITHUB_TOKEN events don't trigger workflows, see the workflow header). The PR bumps `package.json`, `package-lock.json` and `STRATEGY_VERSION` (via the `// x-release-please-version` marker — **never remove that comment**) and writes the CHANGELOG entry from the Conventional-Commit squash titles since the last release
2. Merging the Release PR makes release-please **publish** the (pre-)release directly. No draft: GitHub delivers no `release` workflow events for drafts, and release-please doesn't count drafts as released (learned the hard way on beta.13 — stalled pipeline + phantom next-version PR)
3. `release-build.yml` fires on `release: published`, builds, verifies (`verify-release-version.mjs`, `verify-release-bundle.mjs`) and uploads all `dist/*.js` (+ `.gz`/`.br`/LICENSE) files as individual assets. The release is asset-less for the ~2 minutes the build takes — a HACS poll in that window fails once and self-heals
4. HACS installs tagged versions from the release assets. `hide_default_branch: true` in `hacs.json` prevents installing `main`, which has no `dist/`

- **Do not create GitHub releases or tags manually.** The legacy tag-push workflows are removed — with direct publishing, the App-token tag push would have double-triggered them
- Versioning is configured in `release-please-config.json`. During a beta cycle: `"versioning": "prerelease"` + `"prerelease-type": "beta"` increment `beta.N` on every `feat`/`fix`
- **Cutting the stable release** (e.g. `v1.4.0`): flip `"prerelease"` to `false` and `"versioning"` to `"default"` in `release-please-config.json`; if the proposed version isn't the wanted one, force it with a `Release-As: 1.4.0` footer in an empty `chore` commit. Afterwards flip back for the next beta cycle
- **Repair path**: build failed on a published release → `gh workflow run release-build.yml -f tag=vX.Y.Z`; failed while still draft → "Re-run failed jobs" on the workflow run

**Important:** `STRATEGY_VERSION` is logged to the browser console — useful for asking users which version they have installed.

### Porting Community PRs
When PRs were created against the old codebase and cannot be merged directly:
1. Manually port the changes into the current TypeScript codebase
2. Credit the original author as `Co-Authored-By: Name <user@users.noreply.github.com>` in the commit
3. Close the original PR with a friendly comment + link to the release
4. Issue reference in the commit (`Closes #XX`) automatically closes the issue on merge

## Design Decisions

Deliberate architecture decisions that should not be changed:

### Code-Split Chunk Architecture (PERFORMANCE-CRITICAL)
The bundle is deliberately split into 5 chunks:

| Chunk | Contents | Size | Loads |
|-------|----------|------|-------|
| `main` (Entry) | Custom element registration | tiny | Immediately — must register before HA's 5s timeout |
| `lit` | Lit framework (shared) | small | Async, shared by core/views/editor |
| `core` | Registry, Utils, Cards, OverviewView | medium | Async, for the home screen |
| `views` | Lights/Covers/Security/Batteries/Climate/Room Views | small | Async, on navigation |
| `editor` | StrategyEditor + js-yaml | large | On-demand, only when user opens config |

**Why:** Without code splitting, the entry point was a single large bundle. HA has a fixed 5-second timeout for custom element registration. On slow connections (Slow 4G), the JS file competes with all other HA chunks and custom cards for max. 6 browser connections. With the tiny entry point, the element registers instantly while the rest loads in the background.

**Content-Hash Chunk Filenames:** Chunks include a `[contenthash:8]` in their filename (e.g. `simon42-dashboard-strategy-core.c6a1e2e6.js`). HACS only sets its cache-busting `hacstag` on the entry file — without content hashes, browsers would serve stale cached chunks after a HACS update.

### No Auto-Detection for Temperature/Humidity on Area Cards
The overview area cards only show `sensor_classes` (temperature, humidity) when the user has explicitly assigned an entity in the **HA area settings** (`area.temperature_entity_id`, `area.humidity_entity_id`). No auto-detection because:
- Wrong sensors would be displayed (e.g. printer temperature in the office)
- The user would have no way to remove them
- HA's own Home Strategy does it the same way

**Note:** In room detail views (RoomViewStrategy), sensors ARE auto-detected — they appear as badges and can be filtered via `no_dboard` label or `groups_options.hidden`.

### Pre-filtered Features on Area Cards and Tile Cards (PERFORMANCE-CRITICAL)
Area cards only receive `controls` that actually exist in the area (e.g. `['light', 'cover-shutter']`), not all possible controls. Tile cards only receive `features` that the entity supports (e.g. `light-brightness` only for lights with brightness support, `climate-hvac-modes` only for climate entities).

**Why:** Without pre-filtering, each card must scan all entities itself — with many areas and entities, this causes massive load times on weak devices (tablets, wall panels). Check here first when investigating performance issues!

### Custom Cards: LitElement with Reactive willUpdate() (PERFORMANCE-CRITICAL)
All custom cards (SummaryCard, LightsGroupCard, CoversGroupCard) use LitElement with `willUpdate(changedProps)` instead of the previous innerHTML rebuild pattern. This means:
- HA calls `card.hass = ...` on **every** state change (any entity in the entire system) — this happens hundreds of times per minute
- Without the reactive pattern, each card would rebuild its entire DOM on every `set hass()` call → massive performance problems
- With `willUpdate()`, cards check whether relevant states actually changed and only re-render when needed
- SummaryCard additionally caches relevant entity IDs (`_relevantEntityIds`) and only invalidates the cache on registry changes (`oldHass.entities !== this.hass.entities`)
- LightsGroupCard and CoversGroupCard use tile card pooling (DOM elements are reused instead of recreated)

**Why:** The migration from innerHTML to LitElement + willUpdate was extensive, but without this pattern the dashboard is unusable on weak devices (tablets, wall panels). Do not revert!

### Climate Summary Default: Off
`show_climate_summary` defaults to `false` because not every user has thermostats. All other summaries (lights, covers, security, batteries) default to on.

## Roadmap: HA Best Practices Alignment

Gradual alignment with the official HA Home Strategy. Reference: `../references/ha-strategies/`

**Original problem:** With disabled cache + Slow 4G throttling:
`Error: Timeout waiting for strategy element ll-strategy-dashboard-simon42-dashboard to be registered`
→ HA has a fixed 5-second timeout for custom element registration. Official strategies are part of the frontend bundle (no HTTP request), custom strategies must be loaded as external JS files.

**Analysis result:** The remaining timeout on Slow 4G is a browser connection limit issue (max. 6 concurrent HTTP connections per origin). HA's own frontend chunks + all installed custom cards compete for slots. The strategy JS must wait until a slot is free. We have no control over this — neither HACS nor HA offer prioritization for custom resources. On normal connections (Fast 4G+) everything works smoothly.

### Completed (main)
- [x] LightsGroupCard: innerHTML rebuild → stable DOM + tile card pooling
- [x] LightsGroupCard: custom batch button → heading card with button badges (perform-action)
- [x] SummaryCard: dummy entity hack → own shadow DOM template
- [x] Registry.initialize() in dashboard strategy entry point (race condition fix)
- [x] Lit migration: all 3 custom cards (LightsGroupCard, CoversGroupCard, SummaryCard) to LitElement
- [x] CoversGroupCard: innerHTML eliminated + heading badges + tile card pooling (analogous to LightsGroupCard)
- [x] Bugfix: `hide_mobile_app_batteries` was not passed to SummaryCard
- [x] Lazy imports: entry point reduced to tiny size, instant custom element registration
- [x] Chunk architecture: main → lit → core → views → editor (on-demand)
- [x] Custom cards: set hass() → Lit @property + willUpdate() (HA best practice pattern)
- [x] Area cards: pre-filtered controls + conditional sensor_classes (HA best practice, performance fix for weak devices)
- [x] Views pre-resolved in generate() instead of strategy stubs (like HA Home Panel, eliminates lazy resolution on navigation)
- [x] Chunk loading: immediate start at entry point instead of in generate()
- [x] Dead code removed: createUtilityViews(), createAreaViews() from view-builder.ts
- [x] Conditional tile features: light-brightness, fan-speed, media-player-playback only when entity supports it (supported_features / color_modes)
- [x] Aqara camera support in RoomViewStrategy (community PR #46, ported)
- [x] Toggleable summary cards: clock, lights, covers, security, batteries individually toggleable (community PR #15, ported)
- [x] HA-native area sorting via `use_default_area_sort` (community PR #34, ported)
- [x] Empty overview section no longer rendered
- [x] Editor sections logically regrouped
- [x] LightsGroupCard: optional floor grouping with per-floor batch actions (`group_lights_by_floors`)
- [x] ClimateViewStrategy: new climate view (heating/cooling/idle/off) + climate SummaryCard
- [x] Content-hash chunk filenames for cache busting after HACS updates
- [x] i18n: localize utility + DE/EN translations, auto-detect from hass.locale.language (#56)
- [x] Alert icons on area cards: configurable `show_alerts_on_areas` toggle with curated allowlist (#114)
- [x] Smoke/gas detectors in SecurityView, SummaryCard count, and room badges (#104)
- [x] Security view headings: emojis replaced with MDI icons

### Open: Evaluate
- SummaryCard entity caching removal (HA's home-summary doesn't cache — stateless per render = more correct behavior for dynamic entity changes)

### Phase 2: Align Further Views
- CoversViewStrategy, SecurityViewStrategy, BatteriesViewStrategy — optimize analogous to LightsView
- RoomViewStrategy: evaluate HA patterns (computeAreaTileCardConfig, feature auto-detection)
